                               CSC 3380 - How to Run the App
                        
\***********************************************************************************************/

   1. Firstly, please download Visual Studio 2019 (Community version) using the
          following link: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
        
    2. When installing Visual Studio 2019 onto your device, please be sure to
          download the "Mobile development with .NET" package. Here is a link
          from Microsoft with instructions on how to do so:
         https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/installation/windows
        
    3. Next, when opening Visual Studio, please do one of the following to open
          our project (do either (a) or (b)):
        
         a) Click on the "Clone a repository" button and use this link to copy
                our files: https://github.com/dkirkpatrick-creator/EasyChoiceProject.git
              
                - Our project code should be displayed on Visual Studio at this point.
              
          b) Or, you can download a zip file of our of our files. Then, when opening
                Visual Studio, click on "Open a project or solution". Next, find
                wherever you saved our files from GitHub, and double click on the
                "EasyChoice.sln" file. This will open our project code into Visual Studio.
              
    4. Please see the following link for instructions on how to setup the Android
          emulator (NOTE: our app was developed only for Android, not iOS, so please
          run the emulator for Android) and run a Xamarin application on Visual
          Studio's Android phone emulator:
          https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/first-app/?pivots=windows
        
         I) You can watch the video if wanted, just skip the steps where they
                create a new project/solution, as our solution has already been
                loaded into Visual Studio.
              
          II) If you would like text-instructions, please start from the section
                titled "Step-by-step instructions for Windows", starting from step
                "5." (or "6.") till step "10.", before the "Customize the Application"
                section.
              
    5. The code should run now! With the way our assert() statements are set up, if you
           run into any issues while running our app, our assert() statements will catch
           it, stopping the code and break the debugging process, showing a CallStack so
           that you can trace back to where the error originated from.
